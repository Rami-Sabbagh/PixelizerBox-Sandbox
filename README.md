# PixelizerBox-Sandbox

##About:
  PixelizerBox is a sandbox game where you can create whatever you want with the 2D physics engine (Box2D). The game has been designed with a modding system so you can create and download mods. It has been programmed with Lua so you can hack the code without any problems + 60% from code has been documented. It's licensed under Apache License V2.0 so you can take some parts from the code. Also, You can share mods that hacks the engine and replaces some functions. It's almost like garry's mod but in 2D. We have also included the Physics Editor loader, So you can create some objects without coding !
